# Income Prediction Project

This project is part of the AI28 Machine Learning course at the University of Technology of CompiÃ¨gne (UTC). The objective is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on their profile using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the **Adult** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Scripts for data extraction and loading.
- **images/**: Contains saved figures and charts used in data analysis and model evaluation.
- **lib/**: Contains utility functions and libraries for the project.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks containing the detailed execution and results of the machine learning models.
- **src/**: Core Python scripts automating data preprocessing and model training.
- **run_project.py**: Script to install required libraries and execute the pipeline.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Exploration (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed features and visualized distributions.
   - Identified and handled missing values and outliers.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Categorical data encoding using one-hot encoding.
   - Standardization of numerical features.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented multiple models:
     - Logistic Regression (with and without regularization).
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
     - Decision Trees.
     - Random Forests.
     - XGBoost (ensemble model).
   - Models evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Best Model**:
   - XGBoost achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.69 for the target class `>50K`.
